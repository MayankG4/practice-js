 * Grammer and types in JavaScript

 * Javascript is case-sensitive and uses the unicode character set.
 * For e.g var Fr√ºh = "early"; // is a legal statement
 * 
 * In JavaScript statements end with semicolon although it is not necessary to add a semicolon at the end of a statement
 * it would be wise to add a statement, if multiple lines are added on the same line
